Each time I created a new Rails project these files are required.
I got tired of it and collected them in a gem.

Some files (e.g. reset.css) can be overwritten by a
corresponding one from your project.

Files:

## Installation

As usual:
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "stones"
```
and run "bundle install".

## Recommended

- rvm
- ruby 3.3+
- rails 7.2+

Dropped/cleaned files (still available in version 0.2.5):

- Rakefile
- .watchr
- lib/tasks/backup.rake

## AboutComponent

### Usage
```ruby
...
render AboutComponent(title: "My App", text: "Does something")
...
```

## FlashComponent

### Usage
```ruby
...
flash[:error] = "Something failed"
...
render FlashComponent.new(flash)
...
```

## Rails

"stones" takes care of a tag-head change introduced by Rails 7.x.
